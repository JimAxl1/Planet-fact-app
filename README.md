## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Use a local .json and display it's information.
- Apply SOLID principles
- Use css module

### Continued development

I would like to improve my skill with react since the way it helps to create the ui seems comfortable and simple to me, learn more good practices to have a cleaner code and be able to work on team projects

### Useful resources

- [SOLID priciples](https://developero.io/blog/react-solid-example) - This helped me make components easier to maintain and read, and thus take advantage of react and the component format
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - It helped me when I was running into compiler errors or css issues.
